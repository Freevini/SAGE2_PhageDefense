# SAGE2: Phage Defence mechanisms (spring 2021)

## SAGE course

The SAGE (sequence a genome) course is a master level course at the University of Lausanne for Microbiolgoy students aimed to learn the basics in Bioinformatics. SAGE2 in particular is aimed at doing a self taught research project guided by an assistance. 

## Phage defense mechanisms

Here, in this research project we aim to annotate the many of known phage defence mechanisms to the genomes we previously assembled in SAGE1.
