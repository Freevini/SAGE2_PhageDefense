## Setup

```{r setup ,echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE)

```

## Introduction rMarkdown 

This is an rMarkdown!
rMarkdown is a coding format including both writen text blocks combined with code chunks and also programming output. 
All of this is formatted by a soft latex style. 
Interestingly, you can combined not only r code but also bash, python or whatever programming language you prefer. 
To find out more see [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) or the [cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).

## Introduction git/github

Git is a version control tool. You can think of it as if you are continuous backuping at regular intervals and you can return to certain stages of a coding project if needed. Github is the online platform that you can use to share and publish the code. 
You can sign up for [free](https://github.com/) and download and create your own content. 
I will save, update and distribute my code and presentations in the [my SAGE2 repository](https://github.com/Freevini/SAGE2_PhageDefense).
Let's try to organise the project with it. 

## Let's do biology

Technical aspects aside let's look at the biology. 
If we want to find a specific mechanisms or pathway in our genomes what can we do?


## look at annotations

The first step to find out if a gene is present or abasent is look at the annotations. 
A useful function to scan annotations if you remember is grep. 
With grep you can scan your annotation .gff files as follows:

```{bash echo=TRUE}
grep "modifi" -i /users/vsomervi/scratch/common_files/SAGE_II/Genomes/Lapis_ESL0263/*gff
```

If we find a gene in our annotations this is usually a good sign that it is present (true positives). 
However if it is not there it could mean two things.

Let's see if we can further distinguish between true and false negatives. 

## create and search HMMs

Some genes are very specific for a species or have not been previously annotated, therefore we nee to create specific hmm profiles of the genes of interest.
